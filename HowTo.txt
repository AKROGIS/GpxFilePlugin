How to use:

production/testing:
  copy bin/release/GpxPlugin.dll from bin/release to some stable system folder
  copy reg.bat and unreg.bat to the same folder
  run reg.bat as administrator
  use ArcMap/Catlog as usual
  when you want to remove it, run unreg.dll, then delete the three files

development/debugging:
  copy reg.bat/unreg.bat to bin/debug
  run reg.bat as administrator
  VS project file should launch ArcCatalog after building the debug dll
  you do not need to re-register between builds unless you change the GUID
